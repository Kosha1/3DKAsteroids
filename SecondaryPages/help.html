        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
            Our command ship has been disabled after an enemy attack <br>
            Sweep the asteroid field and protect the ship from collsions. The ship will undergo critical failure if two
            asteroids strike it
        </p>
        <h2>Controls</h2>
        <p>Space: Fire</p>
        <h3>Steering</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                W: Pitch Up &emsp; S: Pitch Down <br>
                A: Yaw Left &emsp; D: Yaw Right <br>
                Left Arrow: Roll Counterclockwise &emsp; Right Arrow: Roll Clockwise <br>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Speed</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Up Arrow: Increase Speed &emsp; Down Arrow: Reduce Speed (can go down to a speed of 0) <br>
                Top left corner of screen has an indicator of the current speed
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Ship View</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A view of the ship and dangerously close asteroids is provided in the bottom right <br>
                Press X to change between a front view and top view of the ship <br>
                Color represents depth. Red objects are closer to the camera and white objects are farther
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The top right corner of screen has useful information in case you get disoriented <br>
                The pitch and yaw values represent the angles to rotate in order to head towards the command ship <br>
                Positive Yaw Angle: Rotate Right &emsp; Negative Yaw Angle: Rotate Left <br>
                Positive Pitch Angle: Rotate Up &emsp; Negative Yaw Angle: Rotate Down <br>
                Note: First get the yaw angle close to 0 and then look at the pitch.
                Changing the pitch angle first will also change the yaw angle
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Warning!</h2>
        <p>
            This game heavily consumes GPU resources (and drains battery quickly). If your FPS is significantly less than 60 (or whatever your 
            monitor's refresh rate is), the game will not be very playable <br>
            Try running it on a device with a better video card
        </p>
